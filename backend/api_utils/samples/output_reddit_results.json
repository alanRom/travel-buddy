The whole meal, the table next to one of the two tables sat empty and by the time the meal was finished 45 minutes later, the restaurant was comically empty. If we had been asked to wait a few minutes to sit together, we happily would have.

The server ruined the entire meal and I would not be back.\n\nShe was inattentive, never offered refills, never brought water, she brought the appetizer and literally brought out the entree within 10 minutes. Checked back once less than a minute after before I had even touched the entree and vanished before I even responded. I left to go to the bathroom and when I came back my food was stacked as if she started bussing the table. Clearly, I didn't want the food after they touched it. I asked for the check and a water when she finally came back over. She came back with the check. I put my card in the thing and she came back to process the card, took it came back and said to have a good night, and I had to ask again for water which I never received, I said politely, \"You must not have heard me, can I have a water\"? Absolutely ridiculous. When she came back she plopped it on the table and left in a huff. What is the rush?! It was 7:30pm.\n\nThe wings were really good but served with only 3 very small pieces of celery. The pot roast was good but VERY dry. Combined with the fact I had no drink for 3/4 of the meal, I couldn't enjoy it. The green beans were good but everything needed seasoning, very bland. I should also mention that the prices were outrageous, not a good value at all. I believe it was 8 wings for $18. That's robbery especially in Buffalo!\n\nWorst experience I had out dining in recent memory. I had thought this was a much nicer place than it was. I had a good meal here during the summer with friends but apparently, they don't care about solo diners.",

And I'm opening a credit card claim bc this is just ridiculous since I had to throw all of them away. Were they blind when they slapped a tiny smear of cream cheese inside? There's no way you could've missed that. At least have the decency to scrape it off first but nope, had zero issues giving me this literal garbage. Just shows you how little they care.

Baked goods are fine but the kitchen food was disgustingly salty where it made our mouths numb (see sweet potatoes pics - couldn't even finish it). The over medium eggs were very under cooked. It was like eating snot (see pic) - couldn't finish that either. The avocado they brought out was so brown (see pic) we had to send it back. We went around 9:30 am so the food should've been pretty fresh. I feel like this was from the night before.\n\nThis coffee house didn't know what a flat white was and gave me a latte which would've been fine but it was barely warm. They were yelling my name across the whole restaurant (literally from the counter to the window seats by the front door) multiple times to come over to get my coffee and started waving their arms and jumping up and down - I was holding my baby while my husband was setting up the high chair and didn't want to burn her (not that it mattered since it wasn't even hot)! It's embarrassing to be shouted at like that and made a scene of because others were starting to look. Like 3 or 4 of them were doing that wth. I got my drink maybe 60 seconds after that and it was already lukewarm.\n\nTheir baked goods are mostly fine. The honey lavender donut is like eating soap or potpurri - 100% pass.

                "My husband and I eat out a lot, and some of our regular restaurants include :\n\n* Saigon Bangkok - Excellent Thai food with a \"date night\" atmosphere. Probably our most frequently visited restaurant, and we go a few times a month.\n* El Canelo - Excellent Mexican food. There may be a small wait time during dinner rush hour, but the food is worth it.\n* Poppyseed Restaurant - Some of the best dinner-quality salads around. They actually feel like a full meal. The other items (pasta, wraps, sandwiches) are all very good as well.\n* Savory's for breakfast. In my opinion, best breakfast place around. Family run restaurant with a rotating board of specials based on what is in season. The bread is all homemade, and I really love their creative specials.\n\nOther places we don't frequent as much but would definitely recommend :\n\n* The Grange. We have dietary restrictions so the rotating menu isn't always our preference, but the times we've gone have been excellent. Great \"special occasion\" restaurant.\n* Cozy Thai is another great spot for Thai food. We tend to frequent Saigon more because we like their curries a little bit more, but before Saigon opened I would go there regularly for their Mango Salad (it's actually Chicken, but delicious)\n* Juicy Burger Bar is reopening along Lake Erie in the former Lago210/Bedrock Eatery location. Highly recommend going there just for the waterfront views during the summer. Burgers are very tasty too, but service can be slow.\n* Johnson's Landing recently opened up, and is a fun place to visit. Indoor and outdoor games, and 3rd floor views of the lake that looks amazing at sunset. Fun place to visit over all, though I thought food was nothing special.\n* If Fish Fry is your thing, I hear really good things about Hoaks.\n* 007 Chinese Food has great Chinese food. I used to go by their place at West Side Bazaar just for the bao, but have not been to their new restaurant since they moved. Hear good things about them though.",

I'm talking go there ASAP because I'd actually bet money they will get a Michelin star (if not more) at some point because it is just that damn good.\n\nThe Garage has a great story, unique and delicious fries, a great menu both for regular days and weekend brunch that has a good mix of traditional foods and interesting choices, and is definitely average in price.\n\nCafe on the Avenue is just the best diner style food I've had around here, and you can feed two people massive meals for under $40 after tax and tip.\n\nHonorable mentions for Daniela, Figmor (in NT but still), and Swan Street Diner (yes I know they're overpriced but it's a cool place and the food is always solid).",

Also cafes have the atmosphere or assumption that ppl will do work/study while there and therefore be by themselves. \n\n- the Little Club on Hertel. Higher end dining with that type of seating or patio\n\n- any Lloyd location\n\n- Swan Street diner.

                "If you're in Amherst/Tona, I like the Family Tree on Bailey when solo.",

                "Billy Club",
                "Literally any restaurant. Go somewhere you been meaning to check out, whether you want to get yourself a table or sit at the bar. All establishment employees will take good care of you",

                "I travel for work and frequently eat alone. I would’ve never done it before I started traveling for work, but then when I did it for work it didn’t bug me at all.\n\nGo to a restaurant you’ve been wanting to try with a bar. If you’re particularly anxious and self-conscious, my pro tip is to wear something business casual and they’ll automatically assume you’re traveling for work. (But also you don’t need to!! Just a tip I’ve told my friends to help get them over the initial anxiety and realize it isn’t as big a deal as it seems.) Just be confident and go up to the hostess and say “it’s just me, do you have space at the bar?/do you serve the full menu at the bar?” Enjoy your meal!",
                "Southern Junction only has counter service, so you just order and pick up your food, might be a good place to start as long as you’re not vegetarian",
                "Bertha’s diner on hertel is a perfect place for a solo breakfast :)",
                "I used to be a field tech and would find myself alone in different cities for days at a time. If I didn't go to a restaurant solo then I would have been one hangry dude. When I want to go to a restaurant now and nobody to go with, I just pretend that I'm on the road, lol.",
                "Any place with a counter to sit at . Family restaurants .",
                "Sitting at the bar helps solo-eating anxiety! I like to bring a book or chat with the bartender when it’s not busy",
                "Going out to eat solo is one my favorite things in life. Truly. Let go of awkwardness and embrace. Anywhere!",
                "For me, it was going to the Galleria mall and ordering food at the food court. I disliked the feeling at restaurants that the waiter would have to come and keep checking in on me as a solo customer. Maybe they didn't care, but anxiety wise I felt uncomfortable, so going to the mall was my stepping stone XD\n\nAfter that, I liked Sato Ramen on Main street for the same reason. It can get busy and close quarters though. In the same vein Taichi Bubble Tea.",
                "Get ready for the “just one” from the hostess. I usually respond with a smile and say “one”.",
                "Try the dapper goose. They get real busy on Fridays/saturdays, but Tuesday-Thursday is calmer. I used to work there and the whole staff is great and will take real good care of you. \n\nI recommend checking out their menu on Instagram first, they usually post it around 5 every day, to see if they’ve got anything you like. It’s a small menu but it changes weekly-ish.",
                "I just had a very pleasant solo lunch at Almaza Grill on Transit. The server was friendly, and it wasn't super busy. Also, the food is really, really good.",
                "I think a good place to start would be 99 Fast Food on Bailey, since people pop in all the time for a quick solo meal especially around lunch time. Service is super quick and the food is amazing, especially the pho and wonton noodles. (Also, don't miss the Vietnamese egg roll and summer roll.) I go in there alone, with my earbuds, and watch YouTube videos while I eat which is pretty normal behavior in real Asian restaurants.",
                "I find the smaller sushi places (like wasabi, sato, or kuni’s) are great for solo dining as you can sit at the bar or a small table and order food. Also any restaurant that has a bar is great for solo dining cause you’re just ripping the bartender for service, so no worries about a petty server getting annoyed serving only one person.",
                "Anywhere. But if you’re nervous about it, any place with a bar or a diner. Idk why but I frequently go to diners alone if I’m in the mood for good cheap breakfast. The Polked Yolk. Swan Street Diner. Campfire Grill. Just show up and put in some headphones and enjoy lol. You won’t be the only one at either of those or bars.",
                "I’ve never had an issue going somewhere alone, that would be incredibly weird",

                "It's the most awkward thing in the world IMHO so I typically stick to diners vs full on restaurants. Feels more comfortable for me",
                "Pretty much any diner.",
                "I took myself on a fancy date on Valentine’s Day this year. A drink and a bite at the bar at Angeline before a concert at Kleinhans. It was wonderful!\n\nI also understand that anxiety can prevent people from trying to do anything social - I’ve been there, too. Maybe try a place with a friend first to get the vibe of the place. It might make you feel more comfortable.",
                "Aroma on bryant has a line of solo diner at the bar nightly.  Same with kunis ",
                "Maybe try somewhere like spot coffee? It’s not technically a restaurant I guess, but they have food! Maybe sit outside and bring a book? Get a sandwich and a drink! Might be a good first step if you’re having some anxiety. Coffee houses have single people sitting around all day!  Or go somewhere and sit at the bar - I was a restaurant manager and no one would think you’re weird for dining alone.",
                "Definitely understand the shark awkward feeling but just know that it is only you that feels that, no one else is judging",
                "Start small,Louis or a spot like Sato Ramen. Places like that are definitely aok for one person and small enough to not set off any of your tics or stress you out. I HIGHLY suggest Sato,they have great sake.",
                "I have always been cool with eating by myself. I typically go to the bar area just so I don’t take up a full table from a server so they can get more money. But I’ve never had any issues ever in many cities across the country and it’s never been an issue.",
                "If you're feeling self conscious or anxious - go to a restaurant with a bar and sit at the bar. You'll never look out of place eating alone while sitting at the bar.",

                "I love solo dinning at Toutant. If I’m doing a lot of a work I get a table but I usually sit at the bar. Thursdays are my favorite days to go because it can be quieter,, less busy than the rest of the weekend",
                "Diners and small ethnic restaurants. Many diners have bar seating specifically for solo patrons. Ethnic restaurants, especially new or quiet ones, will just be glad you're there. Enjoy their hospitality. I get so much free stuff when I go to small ethnic joints, make convo, ask questions, and show that I'm enjoying the food.",
                "Go to a nice spot like Remington and eat at the bar. Or sit outside. TIP AHEAD OF SERVICE and watch how you’re treated. Say hey, I’m just gonna have a drink or two and a bite and watch how friendly the server will be. \n\nServers just hate when you’re holding up a table for 2-3 hours to read a damn book and you tip $5 on an appetizer.",
                "Sato Ramen or Kuni’s, sit at the counter!",
