The server ruined the entire meal and I would not be back.\n\nShe was inattentive, never offered refills, never brought water, she brought the appetizer and literally brought out the entree within 10 minutes. Checked back once less than a minute after before I had even touched the entree and vanished before I even responded. I left to go to the bathroom and when I came back my food was stacked as if she started bussing the table. Clearly, I didn't want the food after they touched it. I asked for the check and a water when she finally came back over. She came back with the check. I put my card in the thing and she came back to process the card, took it came back and said to have a good night, and I had to ask again for water which I never received, I said politely, \"You must not have heard me, can I have a water\"? Absolutely ridiculous. When she came back she plopped it on the table and left in a huff. What is the rush?! It was 7:30pm.\n\nThe wings were really good but served with only 3 very small pieces of celery. The pot roast was good but VERY dry. Combined with the fact I had no drink for 3/4 of the meal, I couldn't enjoy it. The green beans were good but everything needed seasoning, very bland. I should also mention that the prices were outrageous, not a good value at all. I believe it was 8 wings for $18. That's robbery especially in Buffalo!\n\nWorst experience I had out dining in recent memory. I had thought this was a much nicer place than it was.

The server ruined the entire meal and I would not be back.\n\nShe was inattentive, never offered refills, never brought water, she brought the appetizer and literally brought out the entree within 10 minutes. Checked back once less than a minute after before I had even touched the entree and vanished before I even responded. I left to go to the bathroom and when I came back my food was stacked as if she started bussing the table. Clearly, I didn't want the food after they touched it. I asked for the check and a water when she finally came back over. She came back with the check. I put my card in the thing and she came back to process the card, took it came back and said to have a good night, and I had to ask again for water which I never received, I said politely, \"You must not have heard me, can I have a water\"? Absolutely ridiculous. When she came back she plopped it on the table and left in a huff. What is the rush?! It was 7:30pm.\n\nThe wings were really good but served with only 3 very small pieces of celery. The pot roast was good but VERY dry. Combined with the fact I had no drink for 3/4 of the meal, I couldn't enjoy it. The green beans were good but everything needed seasoning, very bland.

I work as a server and I am always pleasant to other people who work in this industry. I have no idea why my drinks were getting slammed down, along with the check book after I paid. Lots of attitude from our bartender. Too bad I won’t be back because of her. Other bartenders appeared to be nice, hopefully when you come here you get a nice one.",

I got 3 bagels and all of them are burned to oblivion on the inside. Barely any cream cheese either. Yeah, definitely won't be back for anything now. And I'm opening a credit card claim bc this is just ridiculous since I had to throw all of them away. Were they blind when they slapped a tiny smear of cream cheese inside? There's no way you could've missed that. At least have the decency to scrape it off first but nope, had zero issues giving me this literal garbage. Just shows you how little they care. There were zero customers and it still took them 15 mins to toast 3 bagels incorrectly.\n\n-----------\n\nThey were not good for menu items for us. Baked goods are fine but the kitchen food was disgustingly salty where it made our mouths numb (see sweet potatoes pics - couldn't even finish it). The over medium eggs were very under cooked. It was like eating snot (see pic) - couldn't finish that either. The avocado they brought out was so brown (see pic) we had to send it back. We went around 9:30 am so the food should've been pretty fresh. I feel like this was from the night before.\n\nThis coffee house didn't know what a flat white was and gave me a latte which would've been fine but it was barely warm. They were yelling my name across the whole restaurant (literally from the counter to the window seats by the front door) multiple times to come over to get my coffee and started waving their arms and jumping up and down - I was holding my baby while my husband was setting up the high chair and didn't want to burn her (not that it mattered since it wasn't even hot)! It's embarrassing to be shouted at like that and made a scene of because others were starting to look. Like 3 or 4 of them were doing that wth. I got my drink maybe 60 seconds after that and it was already lukewarm.\n\nTheir baked goods are mostly fine. The honey lavender donut is like eating soap or potpurri - 100% pass. Even my sweet crazy kids didn't want it. The best thing they had? A sesame bagel with cream cheese. I'd go back just for that. Everything else was a definite no for me.
